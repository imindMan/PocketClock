# Introduce

Special thanks to you, yea, you!<br>
A little bit about this project: this is the pretty simple project without anything so complicated. (because I don't make my project so seriously)<br>

# Requirements

<ul>
    <li>Python >= 3.0</li>
    <li>Tkinter module</li>
    <li>Windows (recommend >=10) (actually you can use another OS, just read the document)</li>
    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
</ul>

Make sure these things have no annoying issues or errors

# Installation

The requirements are the same, except the OS <br>
So, clone it, and before you run it, change somethng in the project.
