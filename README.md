# Pocket Clock

ðŸ•–ðŸ•–The pocket clock - make your life more convenient ðŸ•–ðŸ•–<br>

Pretty simple GUI Clock project using tkinter. The idea behind this project is inspired by the "Alarm & Clock" in Windows 10 ðŸ’». <br>
Some more features are in this project, that is:

<ul>
<!--   <li>File run clock (or FRC, run by using <code>Ctrl + F</code>)</li>
  <p>File run clock counts the time that a <b>Python single file</b> ran, but make sure that your file has a <b>main function</b> in it.</p> -->
  <li>Pomodoro clock (run by using <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code>)</li>
  <p>This clock will help you in study and work, by using the pomodoro clock.</p>
  <li>To-do list (run by using <code>Shift + T</code>)</li>
  <p>You can start make some plans in this section</p>
</ul><br>
