# Pocket Clock

🕖🕖The pocket clock - make your life more convenient 🕖🕖<br>

Pretty simple GUI Clock project using tkinter. The idea behind this project is inspired by the "Alarm & Clock" in Windows 10 💻. <br>
Some more features are in this project, that is:

<ul>

  <li>Pomodoro clock (run by using <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code>)</li>
  <p>This clock will help you in study and work, by using the pomodoro clock.</p>
  <li>To-do list (run by using <code>Shift + Tab</code>)</li>
  <p>You can start make some plans in this section</p>
